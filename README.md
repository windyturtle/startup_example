# startup_example
An example startup project
that has been changed
and now it has been changed in through the github website
but I am trying to change the same line in vscode

From this assignment, I learned how to use the vscode extension effectively to clone, pull, push, commit and solve commit issues in vscode

I am making a website for people to connect on. Something that will stimulate their senses and keep them playing for hours on end. I am making a chess site. Simple as that. People who love to play chess, always want to play chess against others and test their skills. My website will produce a way for them to do so, through finding people similar in skill to the user for the user to play against. They would be incentivized to keep playing through their rank, and the public prestige associated. I know this will work and I am excited to bring this about.
